> This is a fork of the [PrismJS/prism-themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) repository. All included themes are optimized to work with Automad. Also new themes have been added.

Themes can be customized using the following custom properties:

```CSS
:root {
  --am-prism-padding: 1rem;
  --am-prism-border-radius: 0.3em;
  --am-prism-font-size: 0.875rem;
  --am-prism-font-family: ui-monospace;
  --am-prism-line-height: 1.5;
}
```
