## Included Themes

A gallery with screenshots of all included themes can be found [here](https://automadcms.github.io/automad-prism-themes).

## Light & Dark Mode Combos

This collection also comes with a couple of [theme combos](https://automadcms.github.io/automad-prism-themes) that support toggling light and dark mode out of the box. These combos come in two flavors â€” one light and one dark color scheme.

## How to use a Theme

To use one of the themes, just include the theme's CSS file in your page. Theme files can be directly loaded from [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/automad-prism-themes@latest/dist/) or included locally. Example:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <link
      href="https://unpkg.com/automad-prism-themes/dist/prism-tokyo-night.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/prismjs@1.29.0/components/prism-core.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/prismjs@1.29.0/plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Customizing

Some basic theme settings are exposed using CSS custom properties. These properties can be defined for better integration into a site's theme.

```css
:root {
  --am-prism-padding-y: 1rem;
  --am-prism-padding-x: 1rem;
  --am-prism-border-width: 1px;
  --am-prism-border-radius: 0.3em;
  --am-prism-font-size: 0.875rem;
  --am-prism-font-family: ui-monospace;
  --am-prism-line-height: 1.5;
}
```
